# **Online Banking Systems**  

## **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on designing, implementing, and validating a robust database system for an online banking platform. Additionally, we will develop Java code to interact with and rigorously test the database, ensuring seamless functionality and efficiency.  

## **Project Objective**  
This project presents an exciting opportunity for us to work together to design, implement, and validate a robust database system while also developing Java code to interact with and rigorously test its functionality. Beyond the technical aspects, this challenge will help us strengthen our problem-solving skills, enhance our understanding of database management, and gain hands-on experience in building reliable and scalable financial systems. By collaborating effectively and applying industry best practices, we aim to create a solution that is both efficient and future-proof.  

## **Features**  
- **Database Design & Implementation**: Create a structured and optimized relational database.  
- **Secure Data Management**: Ensure the system handles sensitive financial data securely.  
- **Java Integration**: Develop Java-based interactions with the database.  
- **Testing & Validation**: Implement rigorous testing to verify system reliability and efficiency.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Database**: MySQL
